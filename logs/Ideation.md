# The ideation phase for project

So basically  a social media platfrom
where people  make and share roadmaps
its a graph type thing

1. they will get asked question like
what do you wanna do
options: development , competive coding  (option can have read more explaning about the topic)
2. they choose development
they get another question
what development you wanna make
options : app ,website
3. they choose website
they get asked
How you wanna learn
hands on | videos | reading
4. if they choose hands on they get
free or paid
then they get
freecodceamp (free)| codedamn(paid)

so in this way they can be helped for where to start
also people can make such  graps
we will also need ot keep in mind creator side
anyone can make map/graph
so it is a place where people make such graphs
and share it
also we can approve some graphs
and feature them
on frontpage
like
devlopment graph
design graph
so basicly making such thing <https://whimsical.com/mobile-development-roadmap-devsoc-WQEsHr372VrnvxBSaggPnc>
but can be created by anyone
![Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/883274518779543583/883347551514935296/frontend.png)
Some thing similar to such roadmaps
but people can make such graph roadmap
and anyone can post

It will be a social media platfrom where people post/make graphs

also this graphs items can be interactive and show content on hover and show details description about it.
